Get system log from macOS(10.12+) much easier
============

macOS Sierra introduced a new mechanism for both application and system level logging.
Thus we can no longer get system.log from /var/log/system.log.
Which made developer's debugging life further from innocence.
That's why I started this project to just simply log all of system.log to console.
More functionality will be added later, if you have a good idea for this project, don't hesitate to make a pull request for me :)

I wait for you. Wish you all enjoy this tiny but useful program.

How to use maclog?
----------------
- Download binary executable program [here](https://github.com/syscl/maclog/files/692460/maclog-v1.2.zip).
- Double left click to execute it (Note: for first time launch: ```Right Click â–¶ Open```)

If you want to compile it, following the below step:
- Download the latest source code by entering the following command in a terminal window:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/syscl/maclog
```
- Build the project by typing:
```sh
cd maclog
clang maclog.m -fobjc-arc -fmodules -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -o maclog
```

Arguments
---------
maclog default behaviour is to show all log messages of the current day.

The following arguments modify this behavior:
- `--boot`: Show log messages since last boot time.
- `--sleep`: Show log messages since last sleep time.
- `--wake`: Show log messages since last wake time.
- `--darkWake`: Show log messages since last darkWake time.

*note: The messages returned by `--sleep`, `--wake`, `--darkWake` can be from previous days, depending on the last time each action occurred.*
