Get system log from macOS(10.12+) much easier
============

Well as the arrival of macOS Sierra, we can no more get system.log from
/var/log/system.log. Which made developers' life innocence for further
debugging. That's why I start this project to just simply log all the system.log
to console. More functions will be added later, if you have good idea for this project,
don't hesitate to pull issue for me :)

I wait for you. Wish you all enjoy this tiny but useful program.

How to use maclog?
