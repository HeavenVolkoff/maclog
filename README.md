Get system log from macOS(10.12+) much easier
============

macOS Sierra introduced a new mechanism for both application and system level logging.
Thus we can no longer get system.log from /var/log/system.log.
Which made developer's debugging life further from innocence.
That's why I started this project to just simply log all of system.log to console.
More functionality will be added later, if you have a good idea for this project, don't hesitate to make a pull request for me :)

I wait for you. Wish you all enjoy this tiny but useful program.
